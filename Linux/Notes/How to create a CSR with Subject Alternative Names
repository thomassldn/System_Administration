#These notes show how to create a CSR that contains Subject Alernative Names

1: Creat the following configuration file
Ex) something.domain.cnf

# cat something.domain.cnf
[req]
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
req_extensions = v3_req
prompt = no
[req_distinguished_name]
C = CA
ST = Ontario
L = Toronto
O = Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre
emailAddress = email@domain.com
CN = server1.domain.com

[v3_req]
keyUsage = keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment
extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth
subjectAltName = @alt_names
[alt_names]
DNS.1 = server1.domain.com
DNS.2 = server2.domain.com
DNS.3 = server3.domain.com
DNS.4 = server4.domain.com

Note: Make sure there are no whitespaces at the end of the lines.

2) Run the following command to create the csr and key

#openssl req -new -out something.domain.csr -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -sha256 -keyout something.domain.key -config something.domain.cnf

3) Verify the SAN names appear on the CSR: 

# openssl req -text -noout -verify -in something.domain.csr
