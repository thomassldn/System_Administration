#These notes show how  to extract the certificates from a p7b file into one .cer file that contains the certificate chain. 


1) Open the .p7b file in vi

2) Change the leader and trailer of the .p7b file 

  From: 
  -----BEGIN PKCS7-----
  ......
  ... cert stuff ...
  ......
  -----END PKCS7-----
  
  To this: 
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  ......
  ... cert stuff ...
  ......
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
  
  3) Save and close the file 
  4) Use the following command to extract all the contents of the .p7b  file into a .cer certificate chain
  #openssl pkcs7 -print_certs -in <your_p7b_file>.p7b -out <your_cert_chain>.cer
