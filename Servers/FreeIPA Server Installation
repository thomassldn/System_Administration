Desc: These notes show how to install FreeIPA on CentOS7. FreeIPA is a centralized Linux Authentication server,
similar to Windows AD. Different types of operating systems can still authenticate against FreeIPA using SSSD or LDAP.
Note: These notes are just an over view and not complete. They are for reference purposes.

[1] Set FQDN for your server.
Ex)
#hostnamectl set-hostname ipa.domain.com

[2] Open up ports used by the FreeIPA server
#firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port={80/tcp,443/tcp,389/tcp,636/tcp,88/tcp,464/tcp,53/tcp,88/udp,464/udp,53/udp,123/udp}
#firewall-cmd --reload
[]Verify your hostname resolves properly
#dig +short ipa.domain.com

[3] Install a random number generator for the cryptographic operations FreeIPA runs.
#yum -y install rng-tools

[4] Enable rng-tools
#systemctl enable rngd

[5] Install the FreeIPA server
#yum -y install ipa-server

[6] Install FreeIPA with the ipa-server-install command
#ipa-server-install
The log file for this installation can be found in /var/log/ipaserver-install.log
==============================================================================
This program will set up the IPA Server.

This includes:
  * Configure a stand-alone CA (dogtag) for certificate management
  * Configure the Network Time Daemon (ntpd)
  * Create and configure an instance of Directory Server
  * Create and configure a Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC)
  * Configure Apache (httpd)
  * Configure the KDC to enable PKINIT

To accept the default shown in brackets, press the Enter key.

WARNING: conflicting time&date synchronization service 'chronyd' will be disabled
in favor of ntpd

Do you want to configure integrated DNS (BIND)? [no]: no

Enter the fully qualified domain name of the computer
on which you're setting up server software. Using the form
<hostname>.<domainname>
Example: master.example.com.

Server host name [ipa.aguaman.com]:

The domain name has been determined based on the host name.
Please confirm the domain name [aguaman.com]:

The kerberos protocol requires a Realm name to be defined.
This is typically the domain name converted to uppercase.

Please provide a realm name [AGUAMAN.COM]: IPA.AGUAMAN.ORG
Certain directory server operations require an administrative user.
This user is referred to as the Directory Manager and has full access
to the Directory for system management tasks and will be added to the
instance of directory server created for IPA.
The password must be at least 8 characters long.

Directory Manager password:
Password (confirm):

The IPA server requires an administrative user, named 'admin'.
This user is a regular system account used for IPA server administration.

IPA admin password:
Password (confirm):

The IPA Master Server will be configured with:
Hostname:       ipa.aguaman.com
IP address(es): 10.157.4.71
Domain name:    aguaman.com
Realm name:     IPA.AGUAMAN.ORG

WARNING: Realm name does not match the domain name.
You will not be able to estabilish trusts with Active Directory unless
the realm name of the IPA server matches its domain name.

Continue to configure the system with these values? [no]: yes
....
......
........
......
...
Configured /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Configuring aguaman.com as NIS domain.
Client configuration complete.
The ipa-client-install command was successful

ipa         : ERROR    unable to resolve host name ipa.aguaman.com. to IP address, ipa-ca DNS record will be incomplete
ipa         : ERROR    unable to resolve host name ipa.aguaman.com. to IP address, ipa-ca DNS record will be incomplete
Please add records in this file to your DNS system: /tmp/ipa.system.records.CdpCTT.db
==============================================================================
Setup complete

Next steps:
        1. You must make sure these network ports are open:
                TCP Ports:
                  * 80, 443: HTTP/HTTPS
                  * 389, 636: LDAP/LDAPS
                  * 88, 464: kerberos
                UDP Ports:
                  * 88, 464: kerberos
                  * 123: ntp

        2. You can now obtain a kerberos ticket using the command: 'kinit admin'
           This ticket will allow you to use the IPA tools (e.g., ipa user-add)
           and the web user interface.

Be sure to back up the CA certificates stored in /root/cacert.p12
These files are required to create replicas. The password for these
files is the Directory Manager password

[6] Initialize a Kerberos token to verify the Kerberos realm was installed correctly
#kinit admin

[7] Verify FreeIPA is working correctly
Ex)
# ipa user-find admin
--------------
1 user matched
--------------
  User login: admin
  Last name: Administrator
  Home directory: /home/admin
  Login shell: /bin/bash
  Principal alias: admin@IPA.AGUAMAN.ORG
  UID: 1963800000
  GID: 1963800000
  Account disabled: False
